# restaurant_website

This is a fully functional food ordering website. It includes an admin panel that allows C.R.U.D operation on items and categories displayed, 
as well as updating statuses for orders. The website also tracks revenue generated for delivered orders, which I think is a cool feature.
All data is stored in a mysql databse
The admin panel is secured by access control and admin passwords are encrypted.
