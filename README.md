This is a fully functional food ordering website. It includes an admin panel that allows C.R.U.D operation on items and categories displayed, 
as well as updating statuses for orders. Food Items and categoirs have "active" and "featured" labels; if they are not active they will not be displayed, and if they are feautured, they will be displayed on the front page.
The website also tracks revenue generated for delivered orders, which I think is a cool feature.
All data is stored in a MySQL database.
The admin panel is secured by access control and admin passwords are encrypted.
